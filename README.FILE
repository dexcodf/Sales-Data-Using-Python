# 🛍️ Task 7: Basic Sales Summary using SQLite and Python

## 📌 Objective
This project is part of a Data Analyst Internship Task. The goal is to connect Python with a SQLite database, run basic SQL queries, and visualize simple sales data using pandas and matplotlib.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- SQLite (built-in with Python)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- VS Code (Jupyter Notebook or `.py` script)

## 📂 Files Included
- `create_db.py`: Script to create the `sales_data.db` SQLite database and populate it with sample sales data.
- `analyze_sales.py`: Main analysis script that connects to the database, runs SQL queries, and plots a revenue chart.
- `sales_data.db`: SQLite database (you can generate it by running `create_db.py`)
- `sales_chart.png`: Bar chart output showing revenue by product (generated by script).
- `README.md`: This file.

## 🔍 What the Script Does
1. Connects to `sales_data.db`
2. Executes a SQL query to:
   - Calculate total quantity sold per product
   - Calculate total revenue (quantity × price)
3. Loads results into a pandas DataFrame
4. Displays the result in the terminal using `print()`
5. Visualizes the revenue using a simple matplotlib bar chart

## 📈 Output Example

## 🧠 Interview Prep Q&A

**Q: How did you connect Python to a database?**  
A: Using `sqlite3.connect("sales_data.db")`.

**Q: What SQL query did you run?**  
A: I used a `SELECT` with `SUM()` and `GROUP BY` to aggregate sales data by product.

**Q: What does GROUP BY do?**  
A: It groups the rows by product, so we can aggregate metrics like quantity and revenue.

**Q: How did you calculate revenue?**  
A: `SUM(quantity * price)` in the SQL query.

**Q: How did you visualize the result?**  
A: Using a `matplotlib` bar chart with revenue on the y-axis and products on the x-axis.

**Q: What does pandas do in your code?**  
A: It loads the SQL result into a DataFrame for easy analysis and plotting.

**Q: What’s the benefit of using SQL inside Python?**  
A: It combines the querying power of SQL with Python’s flexibility and visualization tools.

**Q: Could you run the same SQL query in DB Browser for SQLite?**  
A: Yes, the same query works in DB Browser's Execute SQL tab.

## ✅ How to Run the Project

1. **Create the database:**
   ```bash
   python create_db.py
python analyze_sales.py
